Overview

  This project aims to analyze tipping patterns in ride-sharing services using a machine learning model. 
  By leveraging a dataset of trip-related attributes, it predicts the likelihood.

Purpose and Key Functionalities

  The purpose of this project is to provide insights into tipping behavior based on various trip attributes such as fare amount, 
  trip distance, passenger count, and time of travel. The model helps ride-sharing companies and drivers optimize service quality 
  and understand factors that influence tipping. 
  
Key functionalities include:
  1.Data preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicates and outliers.
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.
  3.Feature engineering to create predictive variables.
  4.Training a machine learning model to predict tipping likelihood and amount.
  5.Evaluating model performance using metrics like classification accuracy, F1-score, REcall.
  
The steps to set up and run your code, including any dependencies or libraries required.
  1. install.packages(c("glmnet", "class", "keras", "pROC", "e1071", "mltools", "data.table", "dplyr", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "reshape2"))
  2. Ensure that the dataset is stored in the data directory and named uber_Data.csv.
  3. Run the scripts in the order mentioned above.
  4. Modify any configuration parameters directly in the scripts if needed.
  5. Results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, will be saved in the results directory.
